# Next steps

Updated: 2026-09-13

## Current state

- Independent boot, UART, Ethernet DHCP, Rust services, authenticated MCP, and
  fail-closed HID have passed their current development gates.
- The six quarantined video modules load through normal kernel version checks
  and unload cleanly. Generic media/audio exposure remains absent.
- LT6911 control responds only on I2C bus 4/address `0x2b`, but protected ID
  reads return `0000` before, during, and after a proven reset pulse.
- GPIO451 is confirmed as active-low GPIOB3 on ADC1. Its mux and sampled low/high
  reset behavior are correct.
- All ten MIPI RX pads are now assigned function 3 in U-Boot. Removing the
  conflicting CAM_MCLK1 assignment did not restore CSI activity.
- v21 accepted the generic SDK LT6911 configuration but reported every physical
  sample zero, all data lanes `hs_idle`, no high-speed clock, and unknown decode
  format.
- Offline stock-image inspection recovered the product-specific
  `sensor_cfg.ini.LT`: MIPI device 0, lane order `2,4,3,1,0`, no PN swaps, bus
  4, and no sensor MCLK. The SDK parser copies these values directly into its
  runtime sensor configuration. v21 instead used the generic adapter defaults
  for MIPI device 1, lanes `2,0,1,3,4`, and all PN swaps enabled.
- The stock hardware-init script only releases GPIO451 high and reloads the
  GPIO-I2C modules. It does not load bridge firmware, program EDID, or pulse
  reset. The later startup wrapper selects the LT config and starts opaque
  services; strings in `kvm_system` show hardware-version detection but no
  evidence that it automatically invokes the separate EDID updater.
- v22 booted with the exact stock product profile. The receiver accepted device
  0, lanes `2,4,3,1,0`, and zero PN swaps, but all physical samples remained
  zero, all data lanes remained `hs_idle`, `CK_HS` remained zero, and decode
  remained unknown. The product-profile mismatch is therefore ruled out.
- The remaining fault is constrained upstream of the SoC receiver: LT6911
  power/firmware state, HDMI input/HPD/EDID state, or the physical CSI path.
- v23 preserved the bridge's power-on state, performed no I2C transaction or
  reset pulse, and waited five seconds; CSI remained identically idle. Reset
  sequencing and the 500 ms v22 delay are therefore ruled out.
- macOS display enumeration while the HDMI cable was connected showed only the
  built-in display and `S34CG50`; NanoKVM did not appear as a display. This is
  direct host-side evidence that the device is not presenting usable HPD/EDID.
- Sipeed has now published the complete GPL-3.0 EDID utility source. Review of
  commit `bd070b2f5ce27d22618e8a1c8d2bdca543429882` closed the opaque-protocol
  blocker and identified the exact LT6911UXC programming sequence.
- CleanKVM v25 contains an independently compiled, bounded derivative for only
  `/dev/i2c-4`, address `0x2b`, and its embedded checksum-validated E21 payload.
  It is root-only, never starts automatically, reads before writing, requires
  `--program-e21`, verifies all 256 bytes, and resumes the MCU on exit.

## Ordered next work

1. Flash and verify v24, boot with UART visible, and run its bounded local
   programmer exactly once. Do not run the retained vendor executable.
2. Remove power as required upstream, reconnect HDMI, and confirm the Mac
   enumerates NanoKVM as a display.
3. Run the existing status-only CSI gate; require a clock and non-idle lanes.
4. Only after the bridge emits a CSI clock should bounded VI allocation and
   one-frame copying be re-enabled.
5. Remove temporary reset telemetry after the diagnosis is closed and rebuild
   all admitted modules from the final source tree.
6. Continue Phase 3a separately: inventory the ADC/DAC paths, confirm actual
   microphone/speaker/HDMI-audio routing, and design bounded opt-in brokers.

The former upstream-source blocker is closed. Sipeed's published GPL-3.0 source
is pinned in `image/sources.lock`; the retained stock executable remains excluded.

Phase 3a evidence and its staged privacy boundary are now specified in
`docs/PHASE3A_AUDIO_ADMISSION.md`. The next independent build task is a minimal
enumeration-only audio profile and validator. USB Audio, PDM, external I2S, and
all PCM access remain unauthorized pending a separate hardware authorization.

The retained `E21_NanoKVM.bin` has passed offline structural validation: it is
exactly 256 bytes, begins with the standard EDID header, declares one extension
block, and both 128-byte checksums equal zero. Its SHA-256 is
`526e33a7d63d8deddbcbb00bc3b89a3a88fae1059f8d16a5b5b3fbd28742146e`.
It contains `NanoKVM` display strings. This validates the payload, not the opaque
programming procedure.

## Explicitly deferred

- Guessing or copying an opaque LT6911 register table.
- Enabling video or audio through MCP before local hardware admission.
- Restoring arbitrary physical-memory access or executing stock utilities.
- Treating the `0000` ID as proof of a specific silicon failure without a
  stock-state comparison.

## Prepared next image

- Path: `out/phase3-edid-v25/cleankvm-phase1.img`
- Size: 79,692,288 bytes
- SHA-256:
  `e9c18dfbadc571a33fea56310a811685a005e5d92784e9c6e4d538993bab33e4`
- Embedded root-only programmer SHA-256:
  `3f8b4ced84e4445a25c8a058e3d7e194f01af5b757021206e0367c45d0db0195`.
  It is mode `0500`, owned by root, and has no init entry.
- v24 was stopped before bridge mutation when its UART baseline revealed that
  packaging had inherited the prior audio kernel and lacked `/dev/i2c-4`.
  v25 combines the already verified v23 video FIT with the audited new rootfs.
- The resolved 32.0 GB external card was flashed with v25, exactly read back, and safely
  ejected. Boot FIT, rootfs, and FIP matched the audited artifacts. macOS FAT
  bookkeeping changed the whole read-back hash to
  `60050eca74c28d874f499a177f3a2f30a86069d68297e08a1d6fc345969959fe`;
  embedded-artifact verification passed and is authoritative.

- Path: `out/phase3-mipi-status-v23/cleankvm-phase1.img`
- Size: 79,692,288 bytes
- SHA-256:
  `fd83345a8f3a2a1f84c50dcf41e7cd88b895445db55c68c85f673c75071b23c4`
- The build was performed with networking disabled. Source-cache verification,
  normalized video-foundation configuration, rootfs audit, identity ownership,
  diagnostic ownership, FIT hashes, embedded artifacts, and final image hashes
  all passed.
- The first post-boot card presented for verification was a separate v21 card;
  its installed probe and FIP hashes identified it unambiguously. The currently
  selected 32 GB card was then flashed with v22 and verified before ejection:
  its boot FIT, rootfs, and FIP matched the audited artifacts exactly.
- The controlled v22 boot matched the installed probe hash. Baseline taint was
  zero, Ethernet acquired `192.168.2.62`, both Rust services ran, HID nodes
  remained root-only, and no media modules or nodes were present.
- The explicitly approved status test loaded the six quarantined modules and
  confirmed the stock receiver profile. It exited before VI/frame allocation;
  all modules unloaded, no frame or media node remained, and final taint was
  only the expected out-of-tree bit 4096.
- v23 removes the protected-ID I2C transactions and reset pulse from the
  diagnostic. It preserves the LT6911 power-on state, configures only the stock
  SoC receiver profile, waits five seconds for HDMI negotiation, and exits
  before VI or frame allocation. Its card read-back verified the exact boot
  FIT, rootfs, and FIP before ejection.
- The approved v23 hardware test again reported all six physical samples zero,
  every data lane `hs_idle`, `CK_HS=0`, and unknown decode. All modules unloaded,
  no frame or media node remained, and final taint was 4096.

## Prepared Phase 3a image

- Path: `out/phase3a-audio-enumeration-v1/cleankvm-phase1.img`
- Size: 79,692,288 bytes
- SHA-256:
  `208a811401849a2504257bb5e641fd077f0ec3cc96eef7b071907b8141fbdaf7`
- The build ran with networking disabled and reused the established device
  identity and recovery credential. Source-cache verification, normalized
  configuration, rootfs audit, identity ownership, FIT hashes, embedded
  artifacts, and final image hashes passed.
- The kernel is module-free and admits only ALSA core/PCM, its mandatory timer
  support, the CV182XA ADC/DAC machine and codec drivers, internal I2S, and the
  required clock/reset plumbing. Media, USB sound/UAC, PDM, external codecs,
  MIDI, sequencer, and OSS compatibility remain disabled.
- No capture/playback utility or audio broker is installed. The first hardware
  gate is root-only enumeration over UART without opening a PCM device and
  requires fresh explicit authorization before flashing or booting this image.
- The resolved 32 GB removable card was flashed after explicit authorization.
  Exact-length read-back verified the embedded boot FIT, root filesystem, and
  FIP against the audited artifacts before safe ejection. macOS FAT bookkeeping
  changed the whole-device read-back hash to
  `3b3a8dd1c1e8d2d5f9327fb9a2408e4c097f0049cf7f95e4a593e9914bf5f6cf`;
  embedded-artifact verification passed and remains authoritative.
- The authorized hardware boot passed Phase 3a Stage A. ALSA enumerated root-only
  `cv182xaadc` capture (`pcmC0D0c`) and `cv182xadac` playback (`pcmC1D0p`)
  endpoints. Kernel taint was zero; no process held a sound FD; modules, media
  nodes, and UAC were absent. Ethernet acquired `192.168.2.64`, and both Rust
  services remained live. No PCM was opened.
- Next: implement a one-second, memory-only local capture probe with fixed
  format/byte bounds, structural metrics only, explicit cleanup/zeroization,
  and a post-run FD audit. Do not add raw-audio export or MCP audio access.
- Capture-v2 is now built, audited, flashed, read back, and safely ejected. Its
  image SHA-256 is
  `a60d95083c7d8f97181d02175005be85da563ba4b70e83ef3aff0f480e8399c2`.
  After insertion and boot, run its device-free self-test first, then one
  explicitly bounded capture and a post-run PCM-FD/taint/containment audit.
